            <div class="form_instruction">Applying a saved search to your approval form will allow you to showcase relevant post examples within the profile panels of the influencers in your report. (Without a search applied the influencer's most recent 8 posts will show up instead). This feature is most useful if you are working with a client that has a slightly more niche focus. CAUTION : If you choose to enable this, we recommend having a very large set of search queries within the saved search to make sure that enough content is pulled into the profiles. It is also a good idea to review the approval form profile panels to make sure that the saved search is pulling in the right type of content. You will most likely need to fiddle around with the saved search a few times before getting the right combination. (Your account manager will be happy to help with this.)</div>
