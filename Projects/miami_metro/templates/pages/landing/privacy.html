        <div class="main_title">Shelf Inc. Privacy Policy</div>


        <div class="terms_extra">Effective Date:  January 1, 2014</div>
        <div class="starter_paragraph">At The Shelf, privacy is a top priority and We are firmly committed to guarding the confidence You have placed in Us and to use, responsibly and professionally, any information You provide. We won’t ask You for personal information unless We feel it is necessary to provide our Service. We won’t share Your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights. And we will never sell personal information to any third party. </div>
        <div class="starter_paragraph">This Privacy Policy applies to transactions and activities and data gathered through the service (“”Service”) provided on our website. The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to notify You of what information of Yours is collected; how the information is used; with whom the information may be shared; what choices are available to You regarding collection, use and distribution of the Information; what kind of security procedures are in place to protect the loss, misuse or alteration of Information under Our control; and how You can correct any inaccuracies in the information.  </div>
        <div class="starter_paragraph">Please note that this Privacy Policy is a legally binding agreement made between You ("You," "Your," or "Yourself") and Shelf, Inc., a Delaware corporation whose principal office is located at 200 Hoover Avenue, Unit 1211, Las Vegas, Nevada 89101 ("The Shelf” "We," "Us" or "Our").</div>



        <div class="terms_sub_header">1.  Your Information</div>
        <div class="terms_para">In order to operate the Service, and to provide You with information about products or services that may be of interest to You, We may collect (a) "personal information" (i.e. information that could be used to contact You directly such as full name, postal address, phone number, credit/debit card information, or email address); (b) "demographic information" (i.e. information that You submit, or that We collect, including, but not limited to, zip code, hometown, gender,  age/birth date, browsing history information, searching history information, and registration history information); (c) “geo-locational data” (i.e. information that can be used to identify Your physical location); and (d) “meta-data” (i.e. information which describes how, when and by whom a particular set of data was collected, and how the data is formatted. Collectively, this information is called “Your Information”.</div>
        <div class="terms_para">You may be able to login to Our Service through various online third party social media accounts, such as Facebook, by providing Your third party account login information, or allowing Us to access Your third party account, to the extent permitted under the terms governing such account. By granting Us such access to Your third party accounts, You agree that We may access, make available and store (if applicable) any information that You have provided to and stored in Your third party account so that it is available on and through the Service, including, without limitation any information regarding friends, contacts or following/followed lists. If You desire to have Your blog "verified" by The Shelf, We may also require You to grant Us access to personal information on Your Google analytics pages to verify Your ownership of Your blog. </div>




        <div class="terms_sub_header">2.  Information Transfer</div>
        <div class="terms_para">We do not sell or rent Your Information to third parties for their marketing purposes without Your explicit consent and We only use Your information as described in this Privacy Policy. We view protection of privacy as a critical community principle. We understand clearly that Your information and Your trust is one of Our most important assets. We store and process Your information on computers that are protected by physical as well as technological security devices. We use third parties to verify and certify Our privacy principles. If You object to Your Information being transferred or used in this way, please do not use or access Our Service.</div>
        <div class="terms_para">We may share aggregate information that does not identify You personally to match You with third party marketing partners that We believe offer products or services that may be of interest to You.  Please note that, while the aggregate data We provide will not identify You personally, in some instances third parties may be able to “de-anonymize” aggregate data to identify You personally based on additional information they have about You or that they receive from third parties.  While We do not intend for third parties to de-anonymize the aggregate data We provide, if You are concerned about potentially being personally identified by Our third party marketing partners, You should not use the Service.</div>
        <div class="terms_para">In addition, as We continue to develop Our business, We might sell or buy subsidiaries, or business units.  In such transactions, customer information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to applicable data protection laws and the promises made in any pre-existing privacy policy.  Also, in the unlikely event that We, or substantially all of Our assets are acquired, customer information will of course be one of the transferred assets.</div>




        <div class="terms_sub_header">3.  Credit Card Storage </div>
        <div class="terms_para">Your payment or banking information, including credit card information, will be stored by a third party, which is PCI compliant and exceeds industry standards for financial security. Your payment or banking information may be used to charge applicable fees as specified in the Terms of Use. </div>




        <div class="terms_sub_header">4.  Material You Choose to Reveal</div>
        <div class="terms_para">You may post information, including personal information, on areas of the Service that may be viewed by other users or the public, although We recommend that You do not do so.  We urge You to use good judgment. Do not post any information, including without limitation, personal information, that You do not want other users to know.  Many internet connections are public and/or not secure, and other users using that same connection may have access to Your information; please make sure that You are using a secure internet connection.</div>
        <div class="terms_para">YOU ASSUME ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY LOSS OF PRIVACY OR OTHER HARM RESULTING FROM YOUR VOLUNTARY DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION.  </div>




        <div class="terms_sub_header">5.  Cookies/Personal Identifiers  </div>
        <div class="terms_para">In addition to the information gathered as described above, We may use cookies  or similar data storage technologies (“personal identifiers’’) which are necessary to enable Your use of the Service. We will use commercially reasonable efforts, if technically feasible, to delete these personal identifiers from Your device once no longer necessary for such purposes. If You have given Your consent, We may further use these personal identifiers to track the content You view, and the nature of Your interactions with other users of the Service each time You use the Service, so that We can better serve You when You return to the Service. We may also use such personal identifiers to help advertisers and publishers serve and manage ads provided on and through the Service.  </div>
        <div class="terms_para">Because personal identifiers allow You to take advantage of some of the essential features of the Service, We recommend that You allow access.  For instance, if You block or otherwise reject personal identifiers, You may l not be able to use any services that require You to sign in.  </div>




        <div class="terms_sub_header">6.  Web Beacons</div>
        <div class="terms_para">For our website, a “Web beacon,” also sometimes called a pixel tag or transparent GIF, is an object that is embedded in a web page.  It is usually invisible to You, but allows website operators to check whether You have viewed a particular web page or email communication.  We may place web beacons on our website, and in emails We send to You.  </div>




        <div class="terms_sub_header">7.  Third Parties’ Use of Web Beacons and  Personal Identifiers</div>
        <div class="terms_para">The Service may include third-party advertising, links to other websites, and other content from third-party businesses. These third-party sites, businesses, and advertisers, or advertising companies working on their behalf, may use Web beacons and personal identifiers to measure the effectiveness of their ads, personalize or optimize advertising content and to track users who link from their respective websites to the Service.  </div>
        <div class="terms_para">We do not have access to or control over such Web beacons or personal identifiers that these third parties may use.  We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of these third-party websites.  You are encouraged to review the privacy policies of the different websites You visit. </div>
        <div class="terms_para">Some third-party advertising companies may provide a mechanism to opt-out of their technology.  For more information about the opt-out process, You may visit the Network Advertising Initiative website, available at http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp.</div>

        <div class="terms_sub_header">9.  Ownership of Content</div>
        <div class="terms_para">Our databases automatically update any personal information You edit in Your account, or that You request We edit.

        <div class="terms_para">All Content (as defined in the Terms of Use) You provide shall be considered to be Your Content. The Shelf does not assert any ownership over Your Content and You retain full ownership of, and responsibility for, Your Content and any intellectual property rights associated with Your Content.

        <div class="terms_para">We do not sell Your Content to third parties. By making Your Content available to Our Service, You are granting Us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to use, host, display, store, cache, reproduce, publish, transmit, modify, re-format, re-arrange, distribute, and adapt (including, without limitation, in order to conform it to the requirements of any networks, devices, services, or media through which the Service is available), and create derivative works of Your Content. The rights You grant to Us are for the limited purpose of operating and providing the Service, improving the Service, and allowing Us to develop new services. This includes the right to systematically browse Your  blog site Content and Your social media Content (to the extent such Content has been made public) via Our Service software. The reference in this license to "derivative works" is not intended to give Us a right to make substantive changes or derivations to Your Content, but does enable other users to redistribute Your Content by means of their own accounts in a manner that allows users to, for example, add captions, text, commentary, filters, photo-editing, or other Content in connection with Your Content. </div>



        <div class="terms_sub_header">10. Information Retention</div>
        <div class="terms_para">To preserve the integrity of Our databases, Our standard procedures call for Us to retain information submitted by users for an indefinite length of time. The Shelf understands Your submissions as consent to store all Your information in one place for this indefinite length of time, if We so wish. If required by law, as is the case to comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), We will nullify user information by erasing it from Our database. We will also respond to written user requests to nullify account information. </div>

Whenever personal information is disclosed under this paragraph, We may also disclose Your demographic information along with it, on a non-anonymous basis. All of Our parent, subsidiary and affiliated legal entities and businesses that receive Your personal information or non-anonymous demographic information from Us will comply with the terms of this Privacy Policy with respect to their use and disclosure of such information.</div>




        <div class="terms_sub_header">13. Our Security Precautions</div>

If You have registered for Your The Shelf account using the single-sign on or account synchronization applications of Facebook, Twitter, or other social network services, then Your login and password shall be the same as Your social network login and password. In order to maintain this protection, do not give Your password to anyone. The Shelf staff will never proactively reach out to You and ask for any personal account information, including Your password.  For our Web Application, You should sign out of Your account and the browser window before someone else  obtains access. You should never share devices. This will help protect Your information entered on public terminals from disclosure to third parties.</div>
        <div class="terms_para">Unfortunately, no data transmission can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, We cannot guarantee the security of any information You transmit, and You do so at Your own risk. If You have any further questions on this issue, please refer to The Shelf Terms of Use.
