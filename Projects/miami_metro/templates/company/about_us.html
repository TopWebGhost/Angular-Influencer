                <p class="co_mini_subtitle">Lauren Jung &amp; Atul Singh</p>
                <p class="co_body_text">We're Lauren and Atul and we're the co-founders of The Shelf.  We met each other at a salsa dancing class in Princeton NJ about 2 and a half years ago and within days, decided that we were meant for each other (thank you Tom).</p>
                <p class="co_body_text">This very serendipitous meeting also happened to coincide with the demise of our day jobs.  Micromanagers, monotony, and passionless projects eventually began to eat away at us.  6 months later we came up with the idea for The Shelf, and we both set to work (after happily quitting our day jobs).   I handle the design/UX of our site as well as the front-end implementation.  Atul has been in charge of the backend, integration, IP, and scalability.</p>
                <p class="co_body_text">Atul has a BTech from IIT Kharagpur and a PhD in CS from Rice University. His expertise is in software fault-tolerance and he has been published at top-tier conferences (NSDI, SOSP, Infocom).  Most recently he worked at NEC Labs, Princeton, where he led a team in building the first all optical data center network architecture.  I graduated from Furman University with a BA in Fine Art, and later completed a grad program in design from the Portfolio Center in Atlanta.  I worked at an ad company for a brief period as well as a software components company.  When I finished school, I co-founded a fabric design and pattern business (with my mom... because I'm cool).  Our fabric and patterns are distributed worldwide, and we are sorta famous in quilting circles.</p>
