These days I spend 40+ hours per week working on something around the blog and I still very much enjoy it!

Then one day I though ''Why don't I start my own'' and as you can see that's what I did. I chose to write about things I enjoy or like and just things in general."

I love animals (especially cats, I have 3 of thosefurballs called Bindi, Sue and Dewey), games, reiki, reading, chocolate noms, all kinds of creative things, and polish of course! I had a period where I polished a lot when I was younger, but that slowly got less and I started to bite my nails more again. But years later I got infected by the polish-virus once again and I started this blog pretty much as soon as I got my camera in 2010, which was not long after I started polishing. I have periods where I don't post much, but I'm so happy that I made my blog because I've enjoyed it from day 1! The name Oooh, Shinies! comes from World of Warcraft, it was the name of a quest in the game and it's also my reaction to a pretty polish :)"

I technically started this blog wayyyyy back in 2011 during a summer when I wasn't enrolled in hellish summer college classes, soon after seeing an image of watermarble'd nails on Pinterest. While I started the blog in July 2011, I wasn't serious and dedicated about blogging until January 2012 (I slowly built up momentum and joined a birthday group in the fall, so by November and December I was posting better things, but got way more awesome once 2012 rolled around). For as long as I can remember between sometime in middle school and most of college, I had taken up the habit of chewing at my nails and hangnails in times of stress. But when I saw how cool and fun nail polish could be [especially when one was bored and stuck inside to avoid an Atlanta, Georgia summer], I decided I needed to moisturize and take better care of my hands if I wanted to slather them in polish, acetone, and chemicals ;-) Taking care of my fingerbits makes me feel good about myself by providing a creative outlet (tiny, temporary paintings!), keeps germs out of my hangnails, and has also given me some awesome friends.

I'm a big fan of not following trends and going with your gut where your appearance is concerned. I lean classic. I like red lipstick, perfume, nail polish, collecting tee shirts, and being surprised by new accessories. God first, family second. I try to live that way. It's hard. Welcome to my blog. I hope you enjoy it half as much as I do!! ♥"

I got in to my 1st choice uni in Cardiff (UWIC) to study Graphic Communication - this didn't go as well as I'd have liked. I ended up leaving half way through my final year, never to return to finish it. It's a long story, one I won't bore you with :) At that point I realised I needed to start earning money, so I got an admin job at Legal & General where I stayed for a further 7 years until being made redundant in 2008. It was in about 2006/2007 that I really started getting into makeup, before that I hardly wore any, and when I did it was either Urban Decay or Chanel (not much changes eh?)."

I like and loathe change in equal measure, have a big dislike for the very idea of growing up and a huge fondness for spending money I don't actually have. I am incredibly naive and almost always see the good in people, even if there isn't much 'good' to go around. I spend a lot of my time wishing I was one of those people who 'have everything together', but unfortunately the majority of the time I'm just muddling through. I wear false eyelashes on a regular basis and am immediately suspicious of anyone who doesn't like cake and/or Disney films. I have a dog called Rory who is seriously spoilt, and I am currently trying to work out what I'm going to do with my life. I'm hoping it will involve writing, beauty and/or sleeping.

There's more, but that list would be quite long and boring. So your best bet is to stick around to learn more. ;)"

I was homeschooled most of my life (elementary school being the exception) and yes, I did like it for the most part. I have 5 siblings, all younger than me, 4 much younger. My sister, Haley who is closest in age to me is my best friend, and I don't know what I'd do without her or any of my other siblings. I love Jesus and everyday I struggle to be more like Him. I have an extremely supportive family who pushes me to go after my dreams; one of which is to go to Cosmetology school soon (next year, hopefully! *crosses fingers*). Other than my love for beauty I'm a huge music junkie, I consider it to be a huge part of my life and I love finding new artists and music. Some of my current favorite artists are Milo Greene, MS MR, Florence + the Machine, Bon Iver, Lana Del Rey, The xx, Daughter, Walk the Moon, and Arctic Monkeys."

That Grace Girl was started in April 2013 as my place to escape from the monotonies of student life, and focuses upon beauty, with fashion, food, and lifestyle posts thrown in. I owe my love of fashion and beauty to the movie Pretty in Pink, my mum’s wardrobe, and a nine year addiction to Vogue. The rest is down to the trials and errors of twenty-something life. You can also expect posts on anything from books, travelling, stationery, adventures with my boyfriend Danny (the designer/developer of this lovely blog), to movies, music, and magazines. I love coffee, scenic views, autumn leaves, fresh pasta, train journeys, antique shops, coral lipstick, old books, Chanel, peanut butter, big cities, 80′s music, candles, vintage underwear, and John Hughes movies.

Here goes... I was born in the fall of 1970 which I guess makes me older than the hills but younger than dirt, depending on your own perspective. Most days I can feel anywhere between 13 years old to 90. I suspect this is true for most of us, though. I'm a typical product of my generation. Grew up adoring Princess Grace of Monaco Princess Diana, and Christie Brinkley, all blondes, of course. It made me realize at a relatively young age that I was not going to grow up into a great conventional beauty. Then came Madonna and the rest is history. No, not really, but coming of age in the 1980s marks you in a certain way."

My name is Joanne and I'm a mom, undergraduate therapist and writer from the Birmingham area with an adoration for beauty and fashion. I have a partner called Tim and a little boy called T.J, who is currently a boisterous 1 year old. I began blogging as a way of sharing my opinions and thoughts on topics I loved and to connect with like-minded people who shared the same interests. Blog de Sherrell was born in February 2014. In french, it translates as 'blog of Sherrell' (Sherrell - pronounced 'Sha-rel' is my middle name). I've always loved to write and beauty is one of my passions, and to combine the two doing something I've adored for so long seemed only trivial. Being a lone parent and a full time university student, I wanted a means of escapism. Of course, the stereotypical student lifestyle, which my student friends have reveled in, was off the cards for me. Happily, I found sanctuary sitting at my iMac, writing about makeup and skincare, with a little added parenting and lifestyle, in between uni work and fetching T.J from nursery."

And...it has been all downhill from there (for my bank account, anyway)! If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions, feel free to contact me at nailsforthesakeofsanity@gmail.com.

And so, Naturalla Beauty began, in the hopes of helping others who might be in the same position. Now that I'm more able, I’m not opposed to splurging on the right product, but I still get excited about a good bargain and I love finding affordable options that really deliver!

Buiten het schrijven van deze blog werk ik in het Ikazia Ziekenhuis in Rotterdam als Laborant Klinische Neurofysiologie (KNF). Dat is een mond vol tanden hè? Buiten werk en schrijven, lees ik veel boeken (en schrijf ik ook twee boeken) en kijk ik graag films met Alwin. Verder heb ik vroeger veel aan schermen gedaan (net als de drie musketiers. Was zelfs 4 maal Nederlands kampioen), ook hield ik van stijldansen maar daar ben ik beide helaas mee gestopt. Dit door mijn meest onhandige actie ever namelijk het breken van mijn rechterarm.

I do love some good free hand nail art, but I find it had to get inspired these days, which is a shame but c'est la vie!"

Why did I start blogging? If you asked me 4 years ago if I liked makeup and fashion and all that? My answer would be absolutely not. Who knew I would be creating a blog about it. Life can surprise you. It all started when I wanted to leart how to do a french braid and by that video I watched another one and another one... then started watching makeup and fashion videos and fell in love. I was so amazed by this community and how cool it is that we can all share our stories, our tips, and what we love with the rest of the world. Since I'm kind of shy person I decided that this would be a good way to start something on my own. I'm not an expert at anything or a professional, I'm just here to share with you what I know, my thoughts, and most important, do what I enjoy. This is something that I've been thinking about for years and now here I am. I hope you enjoy reading my blog, thank you so much."

I'm totally crazy about my cats, I love scuba diving, riding motorcycles, macro photography (specially tiny insects), traveling around the globe and flying, of course! :-) My passion for polishes started when I was a teenager. I used to do my nails every single day! Really!!! As I was getting older and busier with other stuff, my polishes were kind of left aside. The passion regained life again after following many nail polish/art blogs. It all started with a shoe box filled with polishes and slowly I'm building up my collection. I have now more polish than I can ever count... and yet, it ain't enough... ;-) Some people think it's crazy, others think it's cool."
