,Earthen Weaves,http://earthenweaves.blogspot.in/?view=classic,Heli,"Ahemdabad, India",http://www.in-fb.com/p/infb-directory.html,"Everyone has a Sunday routine, we had too. Once in a month we would set out to the nearby mall, shop, have a hearty family meal and a heartier dessert and then back to the alley with sweet memories. The Sunday rush, traffic and the scorching heat made this routine more tedious than it being enjoyable. The world was getting caught in the fire of online shopping and due to all the convenience it was offering, we could not resist it too. Soon the routine changed to sitting down together, sharing a pint of ice cream and looking for the best deals available. Online shopping helps you get the best of deals but also tempts you to buy more than what you need. Also, going through all the sites to compare or to pick different stuff from different sites is sometimes confusing and sometimes irritating. So this Sunday routine of ours was also jinxed. There had to be something that would solve our woes, right? Roposo.com is our savior this time. This site is a platform where you can browse through the products from all the leading websites that deliver products to India. Roposo.com allows you to go through the carefully curated products from all the sites available. Whats more amazing is that the prices on this site are updated simultaneously with that of the vendor site. Though you might think that browsing through millions of products is difficult and tedious, their amazing filtering option is your answer. If you are looking for cat eye sunglasses, in the range of Rs. 1000-1500, in brown color, it will make this process seem like a cakewalk for you."

Currently I’m pursuing my MBA but my love for all things beauty, makeup, fashion and bridal keeps on growing.

This blog was mainly my place to vent out my creativity and fervor for fashion. Being the first fashion blogger in my city definitely gives me an unfathomable high~ I have always been inspired by fashion and its perfect juxtapositions. I opine that a persons dressing sense articulates who they really are. I believe Fashion changed me spiritually. You know you love yourself when you put in that extra effort to look good, it gives you that extra glow. I envelope myself in different styles and trends but in the end what stands out in them is ME. And thats how ""Be Me"" spawned~ Wearing my soul on my sleeve, I share my effervescent moments with fashion in myriad ways :)"
