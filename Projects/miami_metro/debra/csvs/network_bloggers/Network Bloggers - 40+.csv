This site features REAL WOMEN OVER 40 who take photos of clothes they enjoy and describe what they like about them. We see on non-airbrushed bodies if something looks good on our particular body shape. Women under 40 can see which styles really WILL stand the test of time (and which investment pieces will fit their bodies as they age). It’s a whole new concept."
