I graduated from the University of South Florida with a Hospitality Management degree and I started Aisle Ready as a hobby and a way to express my passion for weddings. As I watched many of my family and friends get married and stood by them at the altar as they said their vows, I realized that a wedding has become more of a hassle for Brides than a glorious and beautiful celebration. Many of the stresses came with the vendors. Without a wedding planner, a bride can feel frustrated and stressed. There is a reason there are people who get paid to plan weddings…. it’s not easy. And as many brides cannot afford to hire a professional wedding planner, I wanted to create a blog that would help brides with their wedding planning. One factor of Aisle Ready that you will not find on many other wedding planning sites are true recommendations. I take pride in providing the most professional and reliable vendors in the industry. Having a reliable and trustworthy vendor takes a lot of stress off the brides’ shoulders. I want to help brides feel confident in achieving their dream wedding and feel inspired. There is nothing more beautiful than love and that is the most important part of the wedding!"

I’ve created this site to be a comprehensive one-stop educational and advice guide for men and women looking to purchase engagement and wedding rings.  Since I have been involved in the jewelry industry most of my life, as my friends began to get engaged and married many of them starting asking me for ring advice; what type of metal to choose for their rings, the value of different sized diamonds, how much a gold wedding band should cost vs. a platinum one, etc.  As I did research online, I realized that there were tons of people searching for advice on wedding rings, engagement rings, and bridal sets, but most advice sites seemed to focus solely on how to buy the best diamond for the money, without going into at all, what type of metal to choose, setting options, or styles.  If they did mention engagement or wedding ring styles, they all seemed to assume that most people wanted to purchase the most standard available styles, and never even mentioned designer rings, antique rings, or colored stone options.  Seeing this, I’ve tried to create a wedding and engagement ring guide that will be helpful to those looking for styles ranging from the traditional, to the contemporary, to the antique.  I hope to make it comprehensive without overwhelming. I have started with the fundamentals and will be continually adding to the site."

Our style can be described as a blend of contemporary documentary, natural light, and fine art. What we love most about what we do is seizing the most honest and beautiful moments of your day. As we quietly search for those moments that define your story, we are using prime lenses and avoiding the use of auxiliary lighting. We remain true to our style and assume when someone chooses us as their wedding photographer it is on the basis of the style of our work and multifaceted talents from architectural, landscape, portrait, product and natural light photography. During portraits we don’t pose individuals, but rather direct them in a way that makes them look natural rather than stiff and contrived. Even our editing/enhancement stage of images are not overly photoshopped or contrived. During post processing we enhance around 400 images or more using bold color, black and whites, as well as film looks to portray scenes in the most honest way that is flattering to our clients and tells their unique wedding day story."

I love old book stores, talking to strangers, hole-in-the wall pizza joints, and enjoying the fresh, honeysuckle summer air. Working with brides and mothers-to-be is the cherry on top of this big ol' stationery business sundae. That's right, I like it when my world revolves around getting to know you. I love hearing the passion couples have for each other and designing pieces that light up with the love they have for each other. Outside of the studio, my husband and I are very passionate about preventing child abuse in America and have dedicated our lives to making our corner of the world a healthier, safer place for children. When I'm not working you can find me walking our sprightly puppies with my husband, Tyler, purchasing anything floral I can find, searching for the perfect pie recipe, and attempting what I like to call ""yoga."""
