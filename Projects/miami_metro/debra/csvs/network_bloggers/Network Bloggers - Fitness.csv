I was using The Gracious Pantry and Skinny Taste for healthy family recipes. I also watched my portions. The best thing I did for myself and my husband was throwing out our enormous plates and eating off of salad plates. Then, after 3 months I hit the gym. When I lost fifty pounds, it hit me- I WILL DO A BIKINI COMP.
So, I hired my AMAZING coaches and this is where I am today: three months into an eight month prep. "

,nycrunningmama,http://www.nycrunningmama.com/,Michele King Gonzalez,"Staten Island, New York",https://www.bloglovin.com/blogs/1/9/us,I’ve always had running as part of my life – I just didn’t realize my love for the sport until many years later. I grew up playing a mix of sports – including basketball and softball. I continued my basketball career through high school and into college where I played on the JV for West Point’s Division 1 team. Running was an integral part of basketball – but it wasn’t something I enjoyed or looked forward to each practice.

As soon as I was able to reach the kitchen cabinets, that is when the struggle with my weight first began. Throughout the early stages of my childhood (4-11) I loved playing sports and being active. I would always be outside on my bike, playing baseball, kickball, football, you name it and I wanted to do it. I vividly remember getting in trouble with my father on countless occasions because I was outside playing too long and never came home. Around the age of 12, for reason’s still unknown to me, I changed. I was no longer the kid who was into sports and enjoyed being active. Sure I would attend the occasional baseball game, but it became something I didn’t even enjoy watching on television. I suddenly wondered how people can get so emotional over watching a professional sporting event. Not only did I not like to watch it, but I also hated playing it. Honestly, I hated doing anything related to exercise. I think the first day I really started to change and develop this hatred for sports was when I got my computer for the first time. "

I began my running quest in 2010 just to drop a few pounds. I used to be a tread/dreadmiller until my friend Shawna encouraged me to hit the pavement and do some real running! I now dread the treadmill but use it as a last resort when the weather conditions demand it! I ran my first marathon in December of 2010 and it was pretty exciting! Once I forgot about the last six miles, hitting the wall, and all of that good stuff; I was ready to run another marathon! My ultimate goal is to run the Boston Marathon and then maybe I will retire…or maybe not."

I was never into healthy eating or active. I adored my couch especially after I had my daughter in February 2007. I fell in love with running in 2010, when my sister in-law came up with the idea of a girls weekend and doing the Royal Family 5k at Disney in Feb 2011. I thought I haven't ran since middle school when I was on the track and cross country team. How am I going to run a 5k, then I went on by saying ""What in the heck is a 5k and how many miles does that consist of?"" I did my research and started C25K (Yes I'm officially a graduate). I went to run a test 5k in November 2010. I was near exhaustion by 2 miles. I thought no way am I gonna be able to do this. I pushed along and finished. FINALLY. I went on to run the Royal Family 5k at Disney and I think from then on is when I truly fell in love with running. I ran the entire 5k and I was so proud of myself. I went to run a few more 5k's that year and then signed up for a 10k. I was surprised I placed 2nd in my age group. I was not expecting anything like that. Then I became a competitive nerd. I ran harder and burned out quick."

My chosen career is User Experience, and I manage a team of UX Researchers and Designers at a financial services firm in St. Louis, MO. Outside of my career though my passion lies in pushing my limits and living my life to the fullest through endurance sports and the enjoyment of food. Growing up I was a year-round USS swimmer. While in grad school I fell in love with running, and since have run over 15 half marathons, 3 marathons, an ultramarathon, and most recently completed two triathlons. I am passionate about these sports, but not to the point where I let it limit my enjoyment of the finer things in life! I believe that you can be a dedicated amateur athlete while still maintaining a life of balance. I do not believe in the following the latest fad diet trend, but rather strive to constantly seek enjoyment by trying new foods and drinks while still staying serious about my training. That being said I like to experiment with all sorts of recipes including vegan cooking, paleo cooking, and more. My Italian heritage influences what I like to cook, and I believe that one can in fact enjoy carbs and still stay healthy! I look forward to sharing stories and tips related to my training and races as well as sharing new recipes and adventures in food."

Instead of repeating ourselves over and over, we thought it would be a good time to just start a blog so people could read and understand for themselves."

I am adjusting to living in a small town. After 2 speeding tickets in 3 weeks, I had to learn to slow down. I love the smell of wet cement. I believe in ghosts. I am terrified of flying insects. I love to throw parties especially when I get to make invitations and decorate. I have a degree in Child Development but could never figure out why the hell my son cried EVERYDAY for the first 2 years of his life. I hate sports on TV. I enjoy doing laundry but I hate putting it away. I think the beach is way overrated especially with children. I get to fly for free. I love to drink red wine, even the cheap sh*t. I read celebrity gossip magazines, in fact I make my husband collect them on all of his flights. I love Christmas. But I hate Christmas decorations on cars. I love to vacuum. I think I use Google a little too much. I recently took up road biking and found I love it. At one time I was diagnosed with post partum depression and anxiety. I have since beat it by competing and training for triathlons. In July of 2013 I hope to complete a Half Ironman. I have yet to be nominated for Mother-of-the-Year but I keep TRI'ing."
