Thanks for taking an interest in my blog to get this far. Stay for a while and see our transition from shopping at the commissary to Trader Joe’s, renting to buying a home, and all of the other changes we’ve went through since John went from solider to civilian. Our lives have transformed into a suburban dream, but we haven’t forgotten the hard facts of life we faced while we were an Army family.  Living in Fort Drum opened my eyes to frugal living, making things instead of buying them, and how to keep a little toddler entertained at home.  Through recipes, projects, and stories I’ll show you how to use the lessons I’ve learned as an army wife to thrive in suburbia."

First of all, it’s very windy here in Kansas and Zephyr is the name of the strong West wind. Secondly, the German family that built the farm in 1901 was called Zeferjahn. After many years, this little spot became known as “Zefer Hill.” I figured it would be a good name for the blog, too, since it revolves around our home life."

In the rare moments I have free time you can find me hiding behind my camera or on my computer editing or blogging. I was home schooled through all of grade school, middle school and 9th grade, yet I am hailed by my closest of friends as being the “only normal home schooled person they’ve met.” I try to find joy in the little things of life, but have to admit that I am a worrier at heart. God has used the journey of my life to show me that He is Sovereign and the He reigns… NOT ME. As a type-A, controller personality, this is hard for me to accept, but it seems that the minute I do everything generally falls into place. This blog was intended to share my thoughts as I journey through life as a daughter of the King, a wife to my husband, a momma to my sons and a photographer of my friends and family. My life is far from easy, and there are days that I literally think that I may go insane, but I think if we’re all honest, we all feel that way at some point of every day.

Every day is a new adventure with her, and I can't imagine my life without her.

I stayed with Blogger up until 2013 and decided that I was tired of finding my work ending up elsewhere with not much recourse and invested in my writing with an upgrade to WordPress.

Mostly, mummy calls me Piglet though – apparently because I am grunting like one when I am being breast fed but I promise, I don’t. I enjoy cuddles with mummy and daddy and love playing with my toys. My favourite activity is making mummy and daddy chase after me though. I am almost crawling now, so nothing is save from me. Today I kicked open a lemonade bottle and everyone got a fizzy sticky shower. Pulling over plant pots is fun as well, but shh don’t tell mummy, she thinks I will start being a good girl in time for Christmas."

My ma maw lived on the lake when i was younger and we use to go to her house every weekend... little did i know that just across the river was where i would meet my husband and be living one day. When i was in the 9th grade my parents decided to purchase a lake home and they looked in a million different places until one day he found a small town that my dad thought was just gorgeous. He drove around a bit and ended up talking to a man who was hitting golf balls in his front yard. Dad was asking him if he knew of any houses for sale in that area and the man told him he would sell him the one he was living in! HAH! My dad ended up buying that house and 10 years later THAT man is my father-in-law and his son is my wonderful husband;) We fell in love at first sight and have been happy every since. We dated for 6 years before he asked me to marry him! And in November of 2008 we said our vows and devoted our love for one another in front of 250 people. Our wedding was beautiful and one of the best days of my life. I'm so glad we met one another because it turns out we were truly meant to be.

I like to blog about balancing motherhood and home life with a full time career, a need to make overly ambitious crafts, a desire to be Miss Martha Stewart, and a wish to salvage a pinch of what’s left of my diminishing ‘me time’. I’m also still trying to figure out if I’m really amazing at multitasking or if I just have ADD."

I am enjoying the luxury of being a Stay at Home Mum (although my husband prefers ""Kept Woman""!) with my beautiful little boy Freddy who was born in 2009 to keep me on my toes.  I also have another four wonderful children.  Joe (1988) lives with his fiancee and their baby son Ted in Northampton.  Megan (1991) is a graduate of the University of Manchester, now making her dreams come true pursuing an exciting career. It makes me so proud to have grown-up children forging their own paths into the big wide world!  Ella (1996) is my lovely teenage guitarist and songstress set to attend university in 2014 and Kizzy (2002) is my comedian, mini-fashionista and ray of sunshine. "

Name Missing No Location,Some Call It Natural,http://somecallitnatural.com/,,,https://www.bloglovin.com/blogs/1/8/us,"I am a stay at home mom of 3 sweeties. We are a home schooling family. We are ‘natural’ by most people’s definitions. We don’t vaccinate, there are no drugs in our house (unless you count coffee and chocolate), our son is intact, I had all 3 kids at home, the only doctors I see are chiropractors and dentists, I bring my own bags to stores (not just grocery stores), our meals are from scratch for the most part, and anything that is packaged that comes in the house must pass the ingredient list inspection. In general, we just try to do everything as natural as possible when it comes to health and parenting. You can read more about why I chose the name of my blog here. I hope you enjoy my blog! It will have anything from family happenings, home school adventures, giveaways, and information on how to live more naturally."

They are aged 20, 16,16,14,14, 5 and 4, which puts us in the unenviable position of having pre-schoolers and teenagers in the same house. I'm originally from Derbyshire, but moved to live in North Manchester 6 years ago."
