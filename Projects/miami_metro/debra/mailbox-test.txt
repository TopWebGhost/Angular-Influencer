What to check when testing mailbox stuff?

Each invitation should create new mailbox, no matter how it was sent.

About invitation popup. We should check that all brand's campaigns are listed 
in campaign links select input. If this influencer has been invited to some campaign,
it should be noted in list  option with '(already invited)'.

First of all, we have multiple places from which we can send invitation messages.
1) From ViewProfile popup (which we can call from search page, campaign's page, 
collection's page, messages page). Here we have button on the right side called 'Message'.
2) Using 'Message or Invite' button for particular influencer on search page.
3) Using 'Send Message' button for particular influencer on collection's page.

However, as we use cache for fetching blogger json, when we have invited somebody
to campaign, '(already invited)' sign may not be visible for this campaign in
links dropdown on blogger's info popup. It should take some time.

If blogger has been already invited to particular campaign and we try to attach
link to this campaign to invitation, we should see warning below campaign links
dropdown and special popup with 'Back' button when we try to send such invitation.

When we've specified campaign for invitation or invited blogger from particular
collection's page, newly created mailbox with this invitation as first message
should appear in corresponding section in messages tab (you can choose to watch
messages from particular category).

In collection's page, we should see two lists at the right side: 'Campaigns',
which is list of campaigns of current brand that this blogger has been invited to,
and 'Collections', which is all brand's collections except current one, that user
belongs to. Each item in a list is link.

In campaign preview and invite pages we should see 'Other campaigns', where <=4
other campaigns of this same brand are listed.

Messages in messages tab should be ordered by last reply, so that the first mailbox
in a list is the one that has most recent reply (or has been sent last). And this
should be like that in all sections (collections, campaigns and so on). The same
applies to messages list in collection's campaign's page.

After removing particular collection or campaign it should be marked as 'Archived'
in messages tab. However, all regular operations like sending reply to mailbox
associated with archived campaign or viewing invite page by blogger should be
working as usual.

Attachments. Try to delete particular attachmnent from list while it's loading.
Try to attach the same file more than once and so on.

Try to send messages from and to different mail clients or even operating systems
(Windows/Mac). See if there are no encoding issues. See that initial message
doesn't get trimmed/truncated/modified in some way.

About displaying messages in messages tab (when you click to expand conversation).
First of all, messages in mailbox should be properly ordered. Each message should
contain only reply part of displayed message (different mail clients add some
quoted content to the message body, this should not be rendered).

Try to send messages back and forth using reply functionality, both from
/messages page and from mail client, try to mix them both in your conversation.

Opened counters in messages tab should be increased each time user opens message
in his mail client. Maybe it will take some time (not too much). The same about
'Delievered' sign, it should appears some time ago after we sent message.
